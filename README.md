# Darkmode.js

ðŸŒ“ Add a Dark Mode / Night Mode to your website in a few seconds

This library uses the CSS `mix-blend-mode` to bring Dark Mode to any of your websites.
Just copy-paste the snippet and you will get a widget to turn on and off the Dark Mode. You can also use it without the widget programmatically. The plugin is lightweight, built-in Vanilla.
It also uses local storage by default, so your last setting will be remembered!

I have been inspired by this article: https://dev.wgao19.cc/2019-05-04__sun-moon-blending-mode/

## Features
- Widget appears automatically
- Saving users choice
- Automatically shows Darkmode if the OS prefered theme is dark (if the browsers support `prefers-color-scheme`)
- Can be used programmatically without widget
